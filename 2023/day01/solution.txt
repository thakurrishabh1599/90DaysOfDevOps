Scaling means automation-driven environment where we need to acquire  devops tools in such a way that it can handle the large traffic on the application for better user experience  .Actually we do scaling in 2 ways 
1. Horizontal Scaling(Either increasing or decreasing the number of servers) 2.Vertical Scaling(By adding ressources to the same server)

Infrastructure are the servers that are present physically or in cloud with limited no of servers,RAM,CPU,core,etc.

- Why DevOps is Important, etc

2. It helps in Faster Innovation as it deployed the product faster then we will have better time to innovate faster.
3. Due to Devops we will have less prone of errors.
4.Helps to reduce Deployment Failures
